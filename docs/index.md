This page points to the final YouTube video produced for our Hackaday Prize entry, sentrifarm.

Why?

    Only the project page owner can edit the hackaday project page links
    And they are not going to be around when the final version is published
    And we can't reserve a YouTube link either


So instead I made a link to this page and our team can edit this to point to the actual YouTube page.
